=== About OsmoSIPConnector

OsmoSIPConnector translates between Mobile Network Call Control (MNCC)
used in the GSM network and Voice over IP SIP call control messages so that
speech calls can traverse through the mobile network to SIP and vice versa. It
has the following interfaces:

- MNCC UNIX domain socket towards `osmo-msc`
- SIP towards the PBX
- The Osmocom typical telnet VTY interface.
